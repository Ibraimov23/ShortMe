							<p class="text">In 1968, Stanley Booth sought out the King, Elvis was a husband and father, his pelvis calmer, and sideburns shorter. Elvis Presley was living in a Federal low-rent housing project, working as a truck driver, movie usher, sometimes forced to sell his blood at ten dollars a pint. The owner, at thirty-three, has been a millionaire for more than a decade. He has other, more elegant homesteads, but these days he prefers the ranch. The privacy is also shared by twenty-two purebred horses, counting colts, and nine hired hands.</p>
							<p class="text text2">Travis tells how Priscilla likes to take her for rides in one of his souped-up go-karts around the driveway at Graceland. Parked in the drive is a shiny red Ford Ranchero with his name, T.J. Smith, on one door under the ranch’s Circle G brand, actually a flying Circle G. Travis: "I sit down here, keepin’ people out, seven in the mornin' till six in the evenin', five days a week, and I’m about wore out. Bought a Rolls-Royce up on blocks four or five years".</p>

						<p class="text">Elvis Presley's recreational activities have been, for a millionaire, unpretentious. In Hollywood, Elvis never goes to nightclubs or premieres, except for work, he hardly leaves his Bel-Air mansion. Elvis is a very straight guy, who uses neither grass nor acid, says one of his oldest friends. In the early days at Graceland (the large, white-columned estate, rather like an antebellum funeral parlor) the big kick was roller skating. After a local rink closed for the evening, Presley and his entourage would skate, eat hot dogs and drink Pepsi-Colas till dawn.</p>
						<p class="text text2">People were wandering from room to room, looking for action, and there was little to be found. In the living room, boys and girls were sprawled, nearly unconscious with boredom. Then, all at once, through the use of perceptions which could only be described as extrasensory, everyone in the room knew that Elvis was there. And, stranger still, nobody moved. Out of the corner of one’s eye Presley could be seen, leaning against the doorway, looking like Lash La Rue in boots, black Levis, and a black silk shirt.</p>
